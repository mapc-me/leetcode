### Problems

### Notes ()
Need to refresh memory about sorted queue, tree sets (maps) `[P1438|M|4]` <br>
Interesting [Dutch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem) `[P75|M|0]` <br>
Could be faster `[P424|M|2]` <br>
Problem with remember formula `[P713|M|2]` <br>
Difficult to determine conditions `[P56|M|3]` <br>
Need for realization with hashmap (faster) `[P1122|E|1]` <br>
New knowledge about prefix sum `[P560|M|3]` (need send solution after a while) <br>
