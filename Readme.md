### Problems should be resolved again

`[P56] - more elegant solution` <br>
`[P974] - should be faster` <br>
`[P238] - should be solved without additional array` <br>
`[P295] - resolve again for a while` <br>
`[P621] - resolve again for a while (was too difficult, make sence to see the best solution)` <br>
`[P355] - resolve again for a while` <br>
`[P57] - make up another solution` <br>
`[P200] - should be improved without Map.Entry` <br>
`[P173] - Could you implement next() and hasNext() to run in average O(1) time and use O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree?` <br>
`[P1031] - Dynamic programming: could be resolved O(N)` <br>
`[P743] - Try to solve with BFS` <br>

### Topics need theory and more attention

`Merge intervals` <br>
