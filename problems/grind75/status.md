### Notes

- Kadane's algorithm
- Solve more merge interval problems
- Solve more binary trees problems
- Topological Sort recall a theory
- Sliding windows is ok. I can detect (medium) fast and implement
- More graph, trees tasks like (133. Clone Graph) should be solved
- Design data structure tasks
- Dynamic programming. Bottom-up and top-down 
- Backtracking
